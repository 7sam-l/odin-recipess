   <h2>What is Bhindi Masala</h2>
   <p>Traditional spicy okra curry that everyone loves. It's best with Indian bread (naan or paratha) or rice. My mom says this is brain food!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 cups okra, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li> 
    <li> 1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 tomatoes, diced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li> 
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to make it</h2>
<ol>
   <li>Place the okra in a large, microwave-safe dish; cook in microwave on High for 6 minutes.</li>
   <li>Heat the olive oil and cumin seeds together in a large skillet over medium heat until the cumin seeds swell and turn golden brown. Fry the onions in the heated oil for 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes to the mixture and cook another 3 minutes. Stir the okra into the mixture; season with the curry powder and salt. Cook and stir the mixture until hot, about 3 minutes more. Serve hot.</li>
</ol>
